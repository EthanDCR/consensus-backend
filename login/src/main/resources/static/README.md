# consensus

A web app that allows for multiple users to collaboarate on a single page or "trip/vacation". The way I would like this to work is that whoever creates the new vacation initially picks the dates and has authority to invite new people. then, once this is all picked , there is an interface for time slots throughought the chosen vtime of the trip, thoughout these time slots, the invited users or the "group" each gets to se;ect a detailed activity with a description of what it would be in any given time slot. The users will then use the website to vote on their preferred activity(users cannot vote their own) and the website will automaticlly display the majority voted acivity over by the "itnerary" section.

Customization Options: Allow users to customize their voting criteria, such as weighting certain voters' preferences more heavily or incorporating other decision-making algorithms.
Integrated Communication: Implement features for group discussions and comments on proposed activities to facilitate communication and negotiation among participants.
Scheduling Alerts: Set up email or push notifications to remind participants to vote on upcoming activities or notify them when the final schedule is ready.
User Profiles: Create user profiles with preferences, past activity history, and favorite activities to personalize the planning experience.
Integration with Calendars: Enable users to sync the final schedule with their personal calendars (such as Google Calendar or Outlook) for easy access and reminders.
Location-based Suggestions: Incorporate location-based recommendations for activities, dining options, or attractions near the planned event location.
Voting Restrictions: Allow event organizers to set voting restrictions, such as limiting the number of votes per participant or specifying certain activities as "mandatory" for everyone to vote on.
Real-time Updates: Implement real-time updates so participants can see the voting progress and final schedule adjustments as they happen.
Mobile App: Develop a mobile app version of the web app for convenient access on smartphones and tablets, with offline functionality for on-the-go planning.
Feedback Mechanism: Include a feedback mechanism for participants to rate their satisfaction with the planned activities and provide suggestions for improvement in future events.
Overall, your idea has a lot of potential for enhancing group decision-making and streamlining the activity planning process. With some additional features and refinements, it could become a go-to tool for coordinating events and gatherings among family and friends.
